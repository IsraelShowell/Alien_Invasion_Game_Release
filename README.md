# Project: Alien Invasion Game
# Current Version: 1.0.1

# Description:
This project is a game developed with Pygame and Python!  

This project came from the Python book, Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.  

I added a few different things to it myself, and I have plans to add to it.  

I typed all the code line by line whilst following this guide.  


# How To Play:
Download the zip file, unzip it in a new folder, and then click the executable!  

Note: Windows may read it as a virus, it did on my computer when I packaged it using Pyinstaller.  

I played around with some of the arguements to make it work, and it ran fine, but let me know if it gives you any trouble!
